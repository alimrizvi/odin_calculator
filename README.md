Variations from the Odin project exercise https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator

- Can write multi-term experssions, like on Apple Calculator and evalate once. As opposed to the guidelines which ask to limit to 2 numbers and 1 operator

- Uses BODMAS rule to evaluate multi-term experssions. Since brackets aren't supported, hence order is Division Multiplication Addition Subtraction

- If you press artithemtic operator after evaluating by = button, moves result + operator to a new experssion

Otherwise this follows the guideliens.
